        <b>Instructions</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This experiment requires your <b>full attention</b> and must be completed in one session. 
        <b>It is important to read the words carefully</b> - move through the sentences as fast as you can while still understanding the sentence. 
        It is common to make occasional mistakes, but participant data that show persistent lack of attention may be rejected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this experiment you will be presented with English sentences and decide how "acceptable" they are as proper and natural English sentences.
        To score a sentence, you will adjust a slider between completely unacceptable and completely acceptable. 
        Move the farther to the left if you find it less acceptable and farther to the right if you find it more acceptable. 
    </p>

        After each sentence, there will be a two second loading period for the next sentence.

        There will be several practice trials to get used to the experiment design before the main experiment begins.
